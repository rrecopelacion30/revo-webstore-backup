    <p>The team here at Mopar<span class="sub-tag">&#174;</span> Authentic Parts & Accessories understands how crucial parts are for your safety on the road. Since the Dodge brothers founded their company in 1900, Dodge vehicles have earned a reputation for durability and performance across every segment. Finding reliable OEM Dodge parts shouldn't be complicated when your <a href=/v-dodge-challenger>Challenger</a>, <a href=/v-dodge-charger>Charger</a>, or <a href=/v-dodge-durango>Durango</a> needs authentic components that maintain that legendary quality. Genuine factory parts ensure your Dodge continues delivering the performance and reliability you expect.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of Authentic OEM Dodge Parts</h3>
    <p>OEM Dodge parts are engineered specifically for your vehicle's make, model, and year. These genuine components undergo the same quality testing as the original parts installed at the factory.
